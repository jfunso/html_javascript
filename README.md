Scripting with Control Statements

Develop a script that will determine whether an online customer for your business has exceeded the credit limit on their account. For each customer, the following facts are available:
a) Account number 
b) Balance at the beginning of the month 
c) Total of all items charged by this customer this month 
d) Total of all credits applied to this customer’s account this month
e) Allowed credit limit 
 
The script should input each of these facts from a prompt dialog as an integer, 
calculate the new balance (= beginning balance -charges + credits),
display the new balance and determine whether the new balance exceeds the customer’s credit limit. 
For customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the script should output HTML5 text that displays the message “Credit limit exceeded.”
